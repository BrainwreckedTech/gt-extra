GT-Extra
========

This is just a personal overlay to add ebuilds from huge overlays that I don't want to use the entirety of.

To Use
------

1. Place `gt-extra.xml` in `/etc/layman/overlays`
2. Run `layman -o file:://etc/layman/overlays/gt-extra.xml`
3. Run `layman -L`
4. Run `layman -a gt-extra`

Ebuilds
